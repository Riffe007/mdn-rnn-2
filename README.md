# MDN-RNN Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Mixture Density Network (MDN) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is designed to effectively handle complex sequential data. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and organized into two primary Python files that define the architecture and functionality of the MDN-RNN.

## Files Description
- `mdnrnn_model.py`: This script includes the MDNRNN class, encapsulating the entire model architecture, including the RNN and MDN layers.
- `mdnrnn_hyperparams.py`: This script sets the hyperparameters for the MDN-RNN model and initializes the model with these default settings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x (compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.0 or higher)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riffe007/mdn-rnn-2.git
   
Navigate to the cloned directory:
bash
Copy code
cd mdn-rnn-project

Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the MDN-RNN model, import the MDNRNN class from mdnrnn_model.py and initialize it with the desired hyperparameters defined in mdnrnn_hyperparams.py.

## Example
python
Copy code
from mdnrnn_model import MDNRNN
from mdnrnn_hyperparams import default_hps

# Initialize hyperparameters
hps = default_hps()

# Initialize and build the model
model = MDNRNN(hps)
model.build_model(hps)

## Training
To train the model, provide the training data in the appropriate format and call the training function.

## Example
python
Copy code
# Assuming `training_data` and `target_data` are available
model.train(training_data, target_data)
